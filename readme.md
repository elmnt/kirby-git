# kirby-git

Another starting point for Kirby CMS projects.  

Reference:  

https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/working-with-git  

In this instance, /kirby and /panel are submobules, for easier updating. I added a TextExpander snippet, so anytime I need to update them, I just execute my bash script with:    

`k-update`  

This is not a usable project yet. Still setting up my source files. Just testing some options. Eventually, I plan to replace my kirby-starter project.
