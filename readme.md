# kirby-git

Another starting point for Kirby CMS projects.  

Reference:  

https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/working-with-git  

In this instance, /kirby and /panel are submobules, for easier updating.

This is not a usable project yet. Still setting up my source files. Just testing some options, before I update my kirby-starter project.
